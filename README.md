# Zendown

Zendown is a system for writing documentation, built for technical writers. Here are its main features:

- **Simple structure**: Articles are files. Sections are directories.
- **Separation of content and presentation**: When you're writing, focus on the content. When you're styling, focus on presentation.
- **Extensible Markdown**: Write yours docs in [Pandoc Markdown][pandoc], and extend it with custom macros.
- **Advanced templating**: Avoid repetition by creating [Jinja][jinja2] templates for different kinds of articles.
- **Multiple languages**: Write your docs in as many languages as you want.
- **Multiple targets**: Deploy to HTML, PDF, or a custom format.
