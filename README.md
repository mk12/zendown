# Zendown

Zendown is a system for writing documentation, built for technical writers.

- **Simple structure**: Articles are files. Sections are directories.
- **Separation of content and presentation**: When you're writing, focus on the content. When you're styling, focus on presentation.
- **Extensible Markdown**: Write yours docs in Markdown, and extend it with custom macros.

Planned features:

- **Multiple languages**: Write your docs in as many languages as you want.
- **Multiple targets**: Deploy to HTML, PDF, or a custom format.

## Quick start

Clone the repository and run `make install`. You'll need Python 3 for this to work.

**TODO: Basic quickstart using zendown.**

## Contributing

For development, run `make dev`. This will download all dependencies and install Zendown in editable mode.

Run `make help` to see other targets, such as formatting and testing.
